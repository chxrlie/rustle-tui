# 🦀 Rustle-TUI a Memorable Password Generator

![Rust](https://img.shields.io/badge/Rust-CE412B?style=for-the-badge&logo=rust&logoColor=white)

A Rust-based TUI application that generates unique, random passwords in the format `Adjective+Symbol+Noun+Symbol+Number(0...9999)`.

## Preview

The application generates random passwords in a terminal user interface.

## ✨ Features

*   Generates unique, random passwords.
*   Stores password hashes to prevent duplicates.
*   Uses a TUI for a user-friendly experience.
*   Includes word lists for adjectives and nouns.
*   **Security Note**: Passwords generated by this app follow a predictable pattern and are more vulnerable to dictionary attacks than completely random passwords. They are not recommended for mission-critical security applications.

## ⚙️ Installation

Make sure you have Rust installed.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
./target/release/rustle-tui
```

Press `g` to generate a new password and `q` to quit.

## 🏛️ Architecture

The application is composed of three primary components:

*   **PasswordGenerator:** Creates new passwords according to the specified format.
*   **StorageManager:** Persistently stores and checks for the existence of password hashes to prevent duplicates.
*   **UIRenderer / App:** Manages the application state, handles user input, and renders the TUI.

See [`Architecture.md`](Architecture.md) for more details.

## 🗂️ Word Lists

The application uses word lists for adjectives and nouns. These lists are embedded directly into the application binary.
You can customize these text files before building the application to tailor the passwords to your preference.
